# ComS311-ImageResizer
Basic Image Resizer Using Dynamic Programming

This was made for my ComS311 class with Pavan. It uses a simple algorithm to resize images, along with a simplified version of edit distance. It is functionally correct, but recieved a lower score due to timeouts when compared to the professor's implementation. I suspect that has to do less with the algorithm, which is similar in both versions, and more in the fact he uses native java classes while I made my own.
